- liq_token_bankruptcy: removed liab_token_index argument
- flash_loan: both begin and end instructions now require the group to be passed as the final trailing remaining account
- flash_loan: the end instruction now requires passing a FlashLoanType, so logging can distinguish swaps from other uses
- ts client changes
  Class Group
  banksMap is now private
  there are now getFirstBankByMint, getMintDecimals, getFirstBankByTokenIndex

  Class MangoAccount
  How to navigate

  - if a function is returning a I80F48, then usually the return value is in native quote or native token, unless specified
  - if a function is returning a number, then usually the return value is in ui token, unless specified
  - functions try to be explicit by having native or ui in the name to better reflect the value
  - some values might appear unexpected large or small, usually the doc contains a "note"

  getMaxSourceForTokenSwap takes sourceMintPk and targetMintPk instead of sourceTokenName and targetTokenName
  simHealthRatioWithTokenPositionChanges takes mintPk instead of tokenName
  getEquivalentNativeUsdcPosition -> getEquivalentUsdcPosition
  getEquivalentNativeTokenPosition -> getEquivalentTokenPosition
  getNative -> getTokenBalance
  getNativeDeposits -> getTokenDeposits
  getNativeBorrows -> getTokenBorrows
  getUi -> getTokenBalanceUi
  deposits -> getTokenDepositsUi
  borrows -> getTokenBorrowsUi
  getAssetsVal -> getAssetsValue
  getLiabsVal-> getLiabsValue

  Class TokenPosition
  ui -> balanceUi
  uiDeposits -> depositsUi
  uiBorrows -> borrowsUi

  Class MangoClient
  Constructor doesnt take groupName anymore, it optionally takes idsSource with the correct default already set
  tokenDeposit now takes mintPk instead of tokenName
  tokenDepositNative now takes mintPk instead of tokenName
  tokenWithdraw -- same as above --
  tokenWithdrawNative -- same as above --
  marginTrade takes inputMintPk and outputMintPk instead of inputToken and outputToken
  marginTrade takes flashLoanType as an argument

- improved logging for off chain services
- `AccountCreate` ix takes explicit input for sizes of various features

Aug 4, 2022 at 09:30:00 Central European Summer Time

ts/client changes

- Renamed `getGroupForAdmin` to `getGroupForCreator`.
- Renamd `getInNativeUsdcUnits` to `getEquivalentNativeUsdcPosition`.
- Renamd `getMangoAccountForOwner` to `getMangoAccountsForOwner`.
- `getOrCreateMangoAccount` and c`reateMangoAccount` take an explicit payer, previously it was just implicitly using the client provider's wallet
- Upgraded anchor npm package to latest.
- Anchor is now a git submodule.

New features

- Many rust liquidator improvements.
- MangoAccount is now dynamically sized and is expandable, there is a new `AccountExpand` ix, default size of account is 8 token positions, and 2 serum3 and 2 perp positions, expanded account has 16 token positions and 8 serum3 and 8 perps for now.
- Group account - has a `creator` field which is set on creation and should never change, is used for pda derivation, has a new `fast_listing_admin` field for governance, and also has a `GroupEdit` ix to change both the admin keys.
- Group account - has a `version` field, version 0 which is used in the setup scripts for now, means serum3 and perp market registration is forbidden, and multiple banks are prevented from been added.
- Each account now has a reserved space of around 256 bytes.
- flash_loan ix 1 and 2 are removed, flash loan 3 has been renamed to just `FlashLoan`.
- `MintInfo`, `Serum3Market`, and `PerpMarket` have a field called `registration_time` which is seconds from epoch, e.g. use case how freshly has the market been added, if it was recently added then liquidity might need some time to improve
- Removed fields and commented out code for address lookup tables.
- New `TokenRegisterTrustless` ix to register tokens trustlessly.
- Insurance fund is now disabled for trustless tokens.
- `TokenRegistration` and `TokenRegisterTrustless` ixs dont take a bank_num anymore, hardcoded to 0.
- Enforced a minimum maximum rate of 50% so that rates don't fall so low that they cannot recover.

- Account data was rearranged to put fields that are often used with gPA first
- The `CreateGroup` instruction now requires an `insurance_mint` account, which is
  used as the mint for the `insurance_vault` token account it creates. Pass the
  USDC mint address.
- The token with `token_index` zero is now required to be the `insurance_mint`.
  Trying to register a different token for index zero will now fail.
- New instruction: `LiqTokenBankruptcy` to resolve insurance fund payouts and
  socialized loss for bankrupt accounts.
- The `PerpCreateMarket` instruction no longer requires a `quote_token_index`
  argument. The USDC/insurance mint is always used as quote currency for perps.
- The `UpdateIndex` instruction now requires the `oracle` account to be passed
  for logging purposes.
- New instructions: `AccountEdit`, `TokenEdit`, `PerpEditMarket` for reconfiguring.
- The `delegate` field on `MangoAccount` is now used and many instructions can be
  called by the account delegate.
- `TokenUpdateIndexAndRate` now maintains dynamic optimal and max rates for token interest rates.

- Renamed instructions:
  - create/close_group -> group_create/close
  - create/edit/close_account -> account_create/edit/close
  - update_index -> token_update_index
  - create/set_stub_oracle -> stub_oracle_create/set
