# Mango v4 Program Change Log

Update this for each program release and mainnet deployment.

## not on mainnet

### v0.19.0, 2023-8-

- Token deposits and withdraws: Allow full withdraw or full borrow repays
  even when the oracle is stale (#646, #675)

  Stale oracles are a problem for Mango because the risk engine can then no
  longer safely determine if a user action is safe or not. Before, a stale oracle
  would completely block interactions with an account until the oracle got
  updated again.

  This change allows some actions even while an oracle is stale:

  - Users with deposits in a token with a stale oracle can now withdraw tokens
    as long as their account health provided by tokens with non-stale oracles
    remains positive.
  - Users with borrows of a token with a stale oracle can now repay the borrows
    (unless they were being liquidated at the time).

  These actions can be used to unblock an account by removing the offending token
  from its balance sheet.

- Expiring delegate: Accounts can now have a short-term delegate (#663)

  This might allow users to temporarily delegate to an in-memory key, so they
  can trade without having to re-approve every transaction on their wallet.

- Flash loan: Start allowing Mango instructions after flash_loan_end (#681)

  Liquidators may be interested in performing actions in the same transaction
  as a flash loan swap.

- Flash loan: The DAO can now charge a deposit fee (#660, #693)

  The DAO can now configure a fee on deposits that happen in flash loans. This
  could be used to apply a fee to flash loan swaps.

  Previously flash loans that did not increase the user's token balance and did
  not borrow tokens were free.

- Stop loss: Respect net borrow limits and change low-health completion (#677)
- Stop loss: Store helpful UI fields (#654, #667)
- Stop loss: Fees are configured by-token instead of globally (#659)
- Stop loss: Avoid expensive health cache for expired orders (#682)
- Account creation: Add account_create_v2 instruction (#680, #685)
- Account resizing: Lower maximums due to tx account limit (#686, #688, #689)
- Account resizing: Fix denial of service if account has too many lamports (#694)
- Token register: Revamp API for simpler use from governance (#665)
- Token register untrusted: Adjust default oracle staleness (#678)
- Fix typo in name of admin_token_withdraw_fees instruction (#655)
- Flash loan: Better errors for missing banks (#639)
- OpenBook v2 integration: First draft of instructions (#628)

## mainnet

### v0.18.0, 2023-7-28

Deployment: Jul 28, 2023 at 08:29:46 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/TaPcQ8dUDyFEaqprasGVEeG3x4Z2nMT7jY9tr2G8KVVf3kvDUQv8TRTjzDirasx3YkyYq3PmQcmcMbCcHsAnUNT

- Introduce limit and stop loss orders for arbitrary spot pairs (#604, #634)

  Allow users to request that a swap between two spot tokens should be executed
  once the price crosses a threshold. Independent of OpenBook markets.

- Improve behavior when listing tokens or markets with upcoming oracles (#620)

  When we listed RNDR before the oracle started publishing a price, there
  was an issue where the stable price got initialized to 0. Now, the stable
  price is only initialized the first time a valid oracle value is read.

- Deprecate Serum3SettleFunds (#606)

  Use the Serum3SettleFundsV2 instruction introduced in v0.8.0.

- Perp FillEventLog: Include amount of closed pnl (#624)
- Pyth: Fix reading most recent valid price (#631)
- Introduce mechanism for moving collected fees to DAO (#644)

### v0.17.1, 2023-7-6

Deployment: Jul 6, 2023 at 20:26:34 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4kiVtR1G3xNh8bTP4FetfG7rjPjLThFjrQNzMMs2TfQHnw7Ezp6JX4rboQbGrJsfZDd6zaMuEa1ZTxahRwPPb9JR

- Remove extra Pyth oracle status check added in v0.17.0

  The Pyth oracle status also reverts to Unknown if not enough publishers have
  reported in a 25 slot window. So checking for the "Trading" status means an
  implicit staleness limit of 25 slots.

  This staleness limit is much more strict than the ones configured on the
  oracles currently used by Mango and caused occasional transaction failures.

### v0.17.0, 2023-7-3

Deployment: Jul 3, 2023 at 09:46:14 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4G6b1uihopkHqp968sq3RYacYHn5ND8mMmeNd1RfswTCmiqeappTN2747JTvswVXxs7oqgfU6M3VKPGVRFPGJYuL

- Configurable perp market settle token (#550)

  This changes perp market margining to no longer assume all pnl is in USD
  while settlement is in USDC. Instead, a configurable settle token is used for
  pnl and settlement, defaulting to USDC.

  There is no difference while the USDC price is forced to $1 and its init and liab
  weights are 1. But with this patch, it becomes possible to change that.

  For now it is not recommended to use a token other than USDC or USDT (or
  another USD targeting stable token) for perp settlement.

  The patch also updates all instructions dealing with the insurance vault
  to be aware that the insurance fund is not in USD but in USDC and apply the
  USDC price before payouts. To do this, the previous
  PerpLiqNegativePnlOrBankruptcy was replaced by a new
  PerpLiqNegativePnlOrBankruptcyV2 instruction.

- Allow reduce-only actions when init health is low (#592)

  Previously when init health was negative, the program only allowed actions that
  increased init health. Now it also accepts actions that keep init health the
  same.

  This is helpful for users because they now can place reducing limit orders on
  the spot or perp orderbooks while their account has low health.

- Whitelist PerpPlaceOrderV2 and PerpPlaceOrderPeggedV2 for HealthRegions (#597)
- Improve logging of loans (#599, #603)
- Pyth oracle status is checked (#607)
- Fixes to the inactive fee buyback feature (#608)
- Fix token force close to respect the reduce-only flag (#613)
- Improve docs (#590, #594)
- Use workspace dependencies (#588)

### v0.16.0, 2023-5-19

Deployment: May 19, 2023 at 15:35:12 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/22fEcghPGgAnYCZkfjTxTeKQwX5rzWSx3c5CV9TikJmaAKWCpubCZYBx5ZJJPeNG1xWUPWMw3ooDhFBRYCR3tKYU

- New event: PerpTakerTradeLog immediately logs your trade execution (#579, #584)

  Previously you had to look at the logs from FillEvent processing to determine
  how much was taken and what the fees were. The new PerpTakerTradeLog event
  is emitted during PerpPlaceOrder and simplifies that.

- Perp self-trade options (#533)

  There are new PerpPlaceOrderV2 and PerpPlaceOrderPeggedV2 instructions that take
  an argument that controls self-trade behavior, similar to OpenBook.

  The old instructions still exist with nearly unchanged behavior: They default
  to DecrementTake, which means being allowed to match against your own orders.
  But now you don't pay fees if you do so.

- Update anchor to v0.27.0 (#582)

  Mango used to depend on a fork of anchor. Now all patches are upstreamed and
  we have upgraded to the unmodified upstream version of v0.27.0.

### v0.15.0, 2023-5-11

Deployment: May 11, 2023 at 09:29:12 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3h6KFxLEAvifNGDBNcQrWdc6cRkpHTzFzL8VradfAXBYNfScrLJzDxm52N4RNmS9dmE84zDuwbErQ75RcxDcihY3

- Change TokenRegisterTrustless instruction to disable borrows by default (#567)

  The instruction is intended to use very conservative defaults for listing
  tokens. It now lists new tokens with zero asset weights and without allowing
  borrowing, which should leave oracle staleness and potential bugs as the main
  risks of listing new tokens.

- OpenBook place order instruction: Respect reduce-only flags on the base and
  quote bank (#569)

  This way the DAO can potentially leave related OpenBook markets open when it
  marks a token as reduce-only.

- FlashLoan: Whitelist the ComputeBudget program when called by delegates (#572)

  For convenience. When constructing a flash loan instruction for a delegated
  account, users no longer need to take care to remove compute budget
  instructions from the flash loan scope.

- Perp Order Matching: Exit when no lots can be filled due to the quote limit (#576)

  Previously it would keep looping unnecessarily.

- Improve error message for incorrect number of accounts in FixedAccountRetriever (#566)
- Add oracle confidence and type information to perp update funding logs (#568)

### v0.14.0, 2023-4-29

Deployment: Apr 29, 2023 at 11:58:43 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2iaLQTT6PqFjFQr94j5g2iUhDT9v6CJk5rNC9mY7cY7BfRjn6pWixnUF5Wv2qAAUq4hmEvM7WyajDxQjq6QbufSk

- Force-closing of perp positions (#525)

  When a perp markets is set to "force-close" by the DAO, anyone can close open
  perp orders and positions on the market. This allows the DAO to wind down perp
  markets if needed.

- Force-closing of OpenBook market use via Mango (#551)

  When an OpenBook market's Mango integration is set to "force-close" by the DAO,
  anyone can close open orders on that market that were placed via Mango.
  This allows the DAO to wind down interactions with an OpenBook market.

- Fix exception for the Jupiter program in flash loan (#552)

  Account delegates cannot execute generic flash loans, but were supposed to be
  able to use whitelisted Jupiter programs during a flash loan. The bug that
  prevented the exception from working was fixed.

- Allow the DAO to withdraw from the insurance fund token account (#561)
- Fix a bug with settle limit accounting when liqors take over positive pnl (#562)
- Improve logging on force-close instructions (#555)
- Fix perp order seqnum logging (#556)
- Fix build when using mango-v4 code with the "no-entrypoint" feature (#558)

### v0.13.0, 2023-4-18

Deployment: Apr 18, 2023 at 17:33:15 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4WWVHCAheTRBhzyXUjsV1Kqfn8LdnkupiVbK4qaPNqby8P5vv7hY6HS3rHHL9bMu1RGdCZvqsd2MHjdawLYQ6Pxi

- Add explicit token account checks to FlashLoan (#542)

  It looks like the reported security issue was not exploitable, but the guards
  that prevented it were too incidental. This change adds explicit checks,
  improving safety and readability.

  It adds the FlashLoanEndV2 instruction, replacing FlashLoanEnd.

- Don't incentivize using asset tokens with high liquidation fee during liquidation (#536)

  Previously liqors received the sum of the liquidation fee of the asset and liab token,
  which meant liqors would preferably liquidate with high-liq-fee tokens.

  After this change only the liab token's liq fee is used. That's sensible because
  the fee is about giving liqors some margin to work with when settling the
  liability they took on.

- Force-closing of tokens (#518)

  Mango already has the concept of switching tokens into a "reduce-only" mode where
  deposits and borrows are only allowed to decrease.

  The new "force-close" mode is even stricter: When it's enabled, liqors can reduce
  an account's borrows of the force-closed token even if the account is healthy.

  The goal is to have a way of winding down the platform's and users' exposure to
  a token if necessary. Only a DAO vote can change a token's state to force-close.

- Improve perp trade logging (#535)

  PerpUpdateFunding now logs the oracle update slot to allow traders to better
  evaluate oracle peg orders.

  Perp fills now create a fill log that contains the fill event seqnum. That allows
  relating the transaction with the order matching to the transaction that processed
  the fill event for the trade.

- IxGate: Fix check for re-enabling instructions (#540)

  The security admin was not supposed to be able to enable instructions, but a bug
  allowed it. With this fix, only the group admin (DAO) can enable instructions.

### v0.12.0, 2023-4-17

Deployment: Apr 17, 2023 at 15:49:33 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2PbaCRMGgpGiysxk5y8x3TdFRZbGEAKZdyAzEQhAMXfCxS4bPN96YZ4Pp6hHfp17fd7RYUd13t4vtjpaFb4ccYRm

- Emit perp fees settled on update_funding (#530)

  Required to have a full picture of total perp market fees.

- Net borrow limit: Separate out tracking from checking (#534)

  That way it's easier to be specific about where the limit should be checked.

### v0.11.0, 2023-4-4

Deployment: Apr 4, 2023 at 21:43:18 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5Z36iV6VhAfmxwZubQduV1hNyUyyB9AyjovAwNrWLb5cdAqGm4F3NGmz6V8VpHT6yUwCEDxm2hWMrdJXNkZ8RSPR

- Limit funding and interest accrual during downtimes (#529)

  Previously, if the funding or interest updating instruction wassn't
  called for a long time (like for a solana downtime or the security
  council halting the program), the next update would apply funding or
  interest for the whole time interval since the last update.

  This could lead to a bad downtime situation becoming worse. Instead,
  limit the maximum funding and interest time interval to one hour.

- Update default interest parameters in token_register_trustless (#523)

  This brings them in line with the recent interest rate changes for >50%
  utilization.

- Perp: Fix logging of funding rate in update funding and deactivate pos (#528)

### v0.10.0, 2023-4-3

Deployment: Apr 3, 2023 at 20:10:26 Central European Summer Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3Rvv7hxqYQ7mPXE7jopzq1RAAoEwPi1pRPY7EubzEiZih8zMVhTMe1AsuYNJq3gwpM8BVVC3CXkAWcsFdd7SE6zC

- HealthRegion: Explicitly whitelist allowed instructions (#508)

  The security council had disabled the HealthRegion instructions after the audit
  found a vulnerability. The issue has been resolved by restricting which other
  instructions may be called in a health region. That way it's still usable to
  save compute units, but its attack surface is significantly reduced.

- Use insurance fund token oracle for bankruptcies (#503)

  This is in preparation for using an oracle for the USDC price instead of fixing
  its value to $1. The insurance fund is in USDC, so the oracle price needs to
  be taken into account once a real oracle is provided.

- Fee buyback: Use the USDC oracle (#504)
- Perp settle fees: Return early instead of error on failure (#526)
- Net borrow limits: Fixed accounting of deposits (#513)
- Better logging in IxGateSet instruction
- Sanity check token_index in TokenRegister instruction
- Allow using all available bytes for bank and market names

### v0.9.0, 2023-3-16

Deployment: Mar 16, 2023 at 11:07:30 Central European Standard Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2hVqFQhxC9BGzDvH7y9bWChrMRvzsBGMPcMepHLBamK4vKJMJG48Fv8ZB54b46qErH1aGRy9YVhFnVnpaKgnoP3c

- Downgrade the "fixed" dependency to v1.11.0 (#500)

  The dependency had a regression. This downgrades to the previous version that
  had been in use with Mango v3, while backporting the safety improvements done
  for release v0.8.0.

- Improvements to perp position docstrings (#497)

### v0.8.0, 2023-3-11

Deployment: Mar 11, 2023 at 08:06:22 Central European Standard Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/61CbcyDaCV1DKHEGxkfNfx9nCUfsH3RgUU7mivTjtqbHJ3YVPX6vNAzn91CZYRsjohVc5LdcZCZtteDKrCiKjYEi

- Introduce a new "fee buyback" feature. (#464, #478, #479, #481, #485, #489)

  If enabled, users who paid perp or openbook fees can optionally perform a MNGO
  to USDC swap at a favorable price to pay fees in MNGO instead.

  For example, if a user had paid 100 USDC in fees, they could use the new
  instruction to pay $90 worth of MNGO instead and get back their 100 USDC
  (concrete numbers and enabling this feature are up to DAO vote).

- The security admin is now allowed to reduce the init asset weight of tokens
  and perp markets to zero. (#482)

  This allows the security council to disable new borrows against a token or
  perp market in emergency situations. The primary usecase is a scenario where
  an oracle no longer tracks the real value of an asset. (like when the soBTC
  price depegged: Mango would have used the BTC oracle for it if it had been live)

- Introduce a new `Serum3SettleFundsV2` instruction (#484)

  OpenBook has a UI fee that bots don't have to pay. Previously, Mango claimed
  this OpenBook fee component for itself. The new instruction allows bots to
  skip paying the OpenBook UI fee when trading through Mango.

  The idea is to avoid penalizing market maker bots for trading on OpenBook
  through a Mango account.

- Make reduce-only behavior more intuitive for PerpPlaceOrder instruction (#483)
- Allow the group admin to edit the token and perp names stored on-chain (#488)
- Allow the group admin to call the `TokenRegisterTrustless` instruction (#477)
- Vendor `fixed` crate to enable general overflow checking in release mode (#476)

### v0.7.0, 2023-2-22

Deployment: Feb 22, 2023 at 14:45:12 Central European Standard Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/2KjMd2GLggSTJGSBQ3T96KK8Pj8XEXSDad65b8AN9gtCo6XdWmaFtewUJbPFvXK8WnKgdTxUNJjftpbtRJNEVhDg

- Security admin can now set OpenBook markets to reduce-only (#472)
- PlacePerpOrder: Improved logging when reduce-only is set (#468)
- PerpSettlePnl: Grant the low-health settle fee even if the settled amount is
  below the flat fee threshold (#458)
- OpenBook: Take referrer rebate as Mango fee (#469)

### v0.6.0, 2023-2-14

Deployment: Feb 14, 2023 at 16:06:03 Central European Standard Time, https://explorer.solana.com/tx/4vpjuiESQZn5t6XErHeSX76dCng4P4KPrr5pMGuYv9LhA3EcLgTw1bYxg8aRmBt1rfJCTqqYLws1cr4EvnrrETue

- Add an optional security authority with the ability to halt a group or
  temporarily freeze user accounts.
- Extend perp pnl settle limits to apply to realized pnl

- Account data was rearranged to put fields that are often used with gPA first
- The `CreateGroup` instruction now requires an `insurance_mint` account, which is
  used as the mint for the `insurance_vault` token account it creates. Pass the
  USDC mint address.
- The token with `token_index` zero is now required to be the `insurance_mint`.
  Trying to register a different token for index zero will now fail.
- New instruction: `LiqTokenBankruptcy` to resolve insurance fund payouts and
  socialized loss for bankrupt accounts.
- The `PerpCreateMarket` instruction no longer requires a `quote_token_index`
  argument. The USDC/insurance mint is always used as quote currency for perps.
- The `UpdateIndex` instruction now requires the `oracle` account to be passed
  for logging purposes.
- New instructions: `AccountEdit`, `TokenEdit`, `PerpEditMarket` for reconfiguring.
- The `delegate` field on `MangoAccount` is now used and many instructions can be
  called by the account delegate.
- `TokenUpdateIndexAndRate` now maintains dynamic optimal and max rates for token interest rates.

- Renamed instructions:
  - create/close_group -> group_create/close
  - create/edit/close_account -> account_create/edit/close
  - update_index -> token_update_index
  - create/set_stub_oracle -> stub_oracle_create/set
